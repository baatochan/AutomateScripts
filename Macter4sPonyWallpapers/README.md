# [@Macter4's][GitHub Macter4] Pony Wallpapers script
That's the [@Macter4's][GitHub Macter4] script I mentioned in my project.

Author: [Maciej Tereszkiewicz][GitHub Macter4]

It has a little different purpose - it's meant to run all the time in the background.

Every time it gets the new wallpaper notification it sends that wallpaper as a picture to tg chat. It has some "security" things for times when the phone gets restarted or there's no internet connection.

Sometimes it may send multiple posts with the same wallpaper in a short period of time.
